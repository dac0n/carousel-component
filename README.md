You can change the carousel appearance by passing additional props into it. Supported props are:

carouselWidth = "number" where number equals to a total width of a component in px.

carouselHeight = "number" where number equals to a total height of a component in px.

slidesAmount = "number" where number equals to an amount of shown slides. 

contentWidth = "number" where number equals to a width of a html content, centered inside slide if it is smaller.
